# ML_codes
This repository is moved from my local hardisk where I used to store all my codes. It contains codes implementing some simple machine learning algorithms, most of which I learned in my spare time via books, papers, online resources, and courses in NJU. I make it public for those who just started their journey in the field of ML and want some simple examples. Many bugs exist in those codes, and I will fix them when I update this repo from time to time. More algorithms will be added when I get enough time for this project(busy college student >_< ! ).
